## <span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1em">Installation</span>
Firstly you must install a pytest module, you can install pytest via `pip`.
However first we should create an environment for collecting packages.
```commandline
python -m venv env  # after execution we'll have a new folder named `env` in the current directory
```
After that we must activate this environment.
```commandline
env/scripts/activate
```
After execution, we will see `(env)` in front of the name of the current director like that:
`(env) PS C:\Users\......`
When environment has activated, we must install pytest.
```commandline
pip install pytest
```
