## <span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1em">Working with classes</span>
To create a class, use the keyword `class`, each method of class has a required argument `self` (analogue of `this`).
The keyword `self` is a link to an instance of class.
```python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name, weight, height):
        self.name = name
        self.weight = weight
        self.height = height
    
    def run(self):
        print(f"Human with name {self.name} is running")

human = Human(name="John", weight=80, height=180)
human.run() # Human with name John is running
print(human) # <__main__.Human object at 0x000002182474EF70>

```
## Decorators `staticmethod` and `classmethod`
Decorator `classmethod` looks like on `static` method, first argument `cls` is a link to class:
```python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name, weight, height):
        self.name = name
        self.weight = weight
        self.height = height
    
    @classmethod
    def create_human(cls, name, weight, height):
        return cls(name, weight, height)

human = Human.create_human(name="John", weight=80, height=180)
```
`staticmethod` we usually use when the code that belongs to a class doesn't use the object itself at all:
```python
import os


class FileUtil:
    @staticmethod
    def create_file(path_to_file):
        with open(path_to_file, mode='wb') as file:
            return file
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_file_content(path_to_file):
        with open(path_to_file) as file:
            return file.read()
```

## Basic inheritance
```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
    self.first_name = first_name
    self.last_name = last_name

class Student(Person):
    pass
```
## Multiple Inheritance
```python
class Person:
    @staticmethod
    def say_hello():
        return "Person said hello"

    
class Father(Person):
    @staticmethod
    def say_hello():
        return "Father said hello"

    
class Mother(Person):
    @staticmethod
    def say_hello():
        return "Mother said hello"

    
class Children(Father, Mother):
    pass

children = Children()
print(children.say_hello()) # "Father said hello"
```
## Public, Protected, Private fields
```python
class Student:
    _schoolName = "QWERTY School"  # protected class attribute
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name  # private instance attribute
        self.__age = age  # private instance attribute
    
    def __display_info(self):  # private method
        return f"Student name: {self.__name} age: {self.__age}"


student = Student("John", 12)
print(student.__age)  # AttributeError: 'Student' object has no attribute '__age'
# but we have access in this case
print(student._Student__age)  # 12
print(student._schoolName)  # 'QWERTY School'
```
## Magic methods
All methods that start and end with a double underscore `__` have a specific name `magic methods`.
In the example above, the magic method is the method `__init__` it's a constructor.
The most useful magic methods:
```python
class Person:
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Creating a Person instance")
        return super(Person, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
    
    def __init__(self, name, height):
        self.name = name
        self.height = height
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person {self.name}"
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Person object {self.name}"
    
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.name == other.name

    
person1 = Person("John", 180)  # Person object John (because we overriden __repr__ method)
person2 = Person("John", 193)  # Person object John (because we overriden __repr__ method)
print(person1) # Person John (because we overriden __str__ method)
print(person1 == person2) # True, because we compare by name (we overriden __eq__ method)
```
