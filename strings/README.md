## <span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1em">Working with strings</span>


To create a string we must write the following construction:
```commandline
message1 = "Hello world!"
```
or we can use single quotes <code>''</code>:
```commandline
message2 = 'Hello world!'
```
Python has two options for creating comments. First option we can be used to explain 
certain line of code with using <code>#our comment</code>:
```commandline
# This is a single line comment that should describe the operation below 
message = "Hello world!"
```
or we can use the different version:
```commandline
message = "Hello world!" # This is a single line comment that should describe this variable
```
The multiline comment <code>"""our comment"""</code>. We usually use such a comment when we want to describe some function or method:
```commandline
"""
This is multiline comment. 
The function or method below does...
"""
```
